The group members are: Jesper Persson and Fanny Malmek. Fanny has forgotten
her password to fire, and therefore can't join the group

Idea 1:
Our idea is to use Haskell and Yesod to implement a sudoku site.
The primary function of the site would be to generate sudokus for the user to solve. 
Depending on the amount of time it takes to learn Yesod, we can then proceed with some new
services, for example, a service for solving a given sudoku, a service for providing the user
with a correct number for a specified position of a sudoku.

Idea 2:
Implement the game of chess without AI. The game would simply be played between two players using
the command line.
